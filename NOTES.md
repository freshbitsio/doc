FIXES

- verbose/debugging mode
- fix the search output to fit the screen
- update the URN's
- implement GET command
- move log, save, push, pull into root command?
- ensure git save, push, pull scenario

- if we don't find any results then ask the user to provide some
  guidance on where to look (ie sources), or give them clues about
  how to perform more specific searches
- the metadata includes both the publication and associated dataset references
- the user can optionally fetch related resources
